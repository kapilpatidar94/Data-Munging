# Data-Munging

This repo contains practice of Data Munging with SOLID concepts.

## This problem statement for the project is following:-    

###  Weather Data

In [weather.dat](http://codekata.com/data/04/weather.dat) you'll find daily weather data for Morristown, NJ for June 2002. Download this text file, then write a program to output the day number (column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is the second column, the minimum the third column).

### Soccer League Table

The file [football.dat](http://codekata.com/data/04/football.dat) contains the results from the English Premier League for 2001/2. The columns labeled 'F' and 'A' contain the total number of goals scored for and against each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79 goals against opponents, and had 36 goals scored against them). Write a program to print the name of the team with the smallest difference in 'for' and 'against' goals.

### DRY Fusion

Take the two programs written previously and factor out as much common code as possible, leaving you with two smaller programs and some kind of shared functionality.
And the final problem statement for the given are as:-

## Follow some rules:
```
1. SOLID Principle
2. Code up the implementation for weather data.
3. Code up the implementation for football data.
4. Separate Files for weather and football.
5. Breakdown of methods for each purpose.
6. Use of Single Responsibility Principle.
7. Use of Open Closed Principle.
8. Read Data through fast-csv
9. Refactor file to objects of array.
